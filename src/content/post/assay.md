The clock strikes midnight, and time flows quietly in the stillness. The night is a
canvas of darkness, brushed with silver strokes from the moon above. Within this
sanctuary of academia—the Peking University—night brings a quietude and profundity
unlike the daylight hours. Unable to sleep due to an undercurrent of anxiety, a swell of
unarticulated emotions rises within me. Seeking solace and a space for contemplation
under the vast night sky, I decide to leave my dormitory behind and make my way to
Weiming Lake.

Weiming Lake has always been a place of solace for many who walk on these
hallowed grounds. It is not just a body of water but a mirror that reflects the passage of
time and the myriad lives that have crossed its banks. As I approach the lake, the cool
night air embraces me, carrying with it the whispers of history. Moonlight spills onto
the surface of Weiming Lake, its ripples shimmering as if reflecting countless stars from
the heavens. Walking along the lakeside path, my steps are light and unhurried, each
one seeming to tread upon the memory of history. This is PKU, a place that carries
countless dreams and tales.

One o'clock. The lampposts lining the path flicker intermittently, casting long
shadows that dance on the ground. Their intermittent glow pulsates like heartbeats,
whispering stories of yesteryears. Occasionally, a cool breeze brushes past, bringing
with it a hint of autumn and stirring memories long buried within me. People, events,
and objects from the past become vividly clear yet distant in this moment. A friend's
laughter echoes faintly, a classroom discussion comes alive again, and the first days oforientation seem both near and far.

Half past one, as I reach the heart island of the lake, I find a bench beneath a willow
tree, its branches gently swaying in the night wind. Sitting down, I am enveloped by
the serenity of the surroundings. The willows by the lake sway gently in the wind, like
dancers moving gracefully under the moon. Their intertwined branches cast patches of
shadows, much like the joys and sorrows of life, intricate and inseparable. Now,
everything around me seems so tranquil, while the voice within resonates—a yearning
for the future and a remembrance of the past.

The lake itself is a metaphor for life; its waters, though calm on the surface, hide
depths unknown. Just as life can appear peaceful from afar, it is filled with unseen
currents and depths that shape our journey. The reflections on the water’s surface
remind me of how we often project our desires and fears into the world around us,
creating a reality that may be only a fraction of what truly exists. In the silence of the
night, I reflect on the choices I've made, the paths I've taken, and those I've yet to
explore.

Time passed so quick and six o'clock arrives, and the first thread of dawn begins to
pierce through the darkness. I stand by the stone boat, gazing at the gradually
brightening sky. This is the most serene moment of the day, when all things await the
arrival of a new day. At this moment, I feel an unprecedented calm, as if all worries
have been consumed by the night, leaving only the most authentic self. The early
morning birdsong breaks the silence, signaling the start of a new cycle. Nature follows
its rhythm, and so should we.

As the sun slowly ascends, a new day is about to begin. I turn away from the
lakeside, carrying profound insights and hope, preparing to welcome the coming days.
And this nocturnal stroll will remain a cherished memory, forever treasured deep within
my heart. The experience of walking by Weiming Lake under the cover of night has
provided not only a respite from the stresses of daily life but also a deeper connection
with the essence of being. It has reminded me of the importance of finding moments of
solitude amidst the chaos of existence, to listen to the inner voice that guides us towards
our true selves.

As the poem goes, “Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.” This line
resonates with a sense of finality and perhaps even sadness. However, my experience
this night by Weiming Lake felt markedly different. Rather than a resignation to life's
demands, it was a reconnection—a rediscovery of peace and purpose.

By the time dawn approached, I did not feel the weight of impending obligations.
Instead, there was a lightness, a renewed clarity about how to approach the challenges
ahead. The night had offered more than solitude; it had provided a rare moment of selfdiscovery and reconciliation with the uncertainties of life. As I prepared to leave the
lakeside, I carried with me not only memories but also a newfound resolve to embrace
each day with openness and courage, knowing that within moments of stillness lie
profound truths waiting to be uncovered.

In contrast to the narrator in Rhapsody on a Windy Night, who grows increasingly
desperate as the night progresses, my wanderings around Weiming Lake led to a sense
of peace and renewal. The night, far from being futile, had become a canvas upon which
I could paint new possibilities, ready to face the morning with a heart unburdened and
a spirit rejuvenated. So, good night, and have a nice day.
